# Data collection

Data scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century. When performing data science, a lot of time is spent in collecting useful data and pre-processing it. If the collected data is of bad quality, it can lead to bad quality models. Hence, it is very important to understand how to collect good quality data. Also, it is important to understand various ways in which data can be collected.

In this module I will discuss different aspects of data collection. I will begin with discussions around decisions to make while doing data collection, data collection rules and approaches, and ways of performing data collection. Further, data can be collected from the web by scraping. Hence, we will learn how to perform basic scraping. Lastly, we will discuss briefly about collecting graph data as well as data collection using IoT sensors.
